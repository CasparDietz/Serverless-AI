# Serverless-AI
Function as a Service (FaaS) is a category of cloud computing services which is becoming very popular. It provides a serverless paradigm to execute modular pieces of code (denoted as functions) on a cloud platform. Functions (that can be scaled dynamically and independently by the cloud provider) are executed transparently in Docker containers, so that users can focus only on the application code, without having to manage the infrastructure. FaaS proves to be cost-effective, especially for dynamic workloads, since users pay only for the resources they use, not for the provisioned maximum capacity required by their system. 
Moreover, FaaS is also well received to support AI applications in computing continua because they can benefit both from the reduced latency and increased privacy and can support partition switching of deep neural networks distributed on multiple components with the aim of optimizing the application execution time and resource usage. 
In this context, some works focus on application function placement on edge-cloud [Sedghani2021a] and public-private cloud [Das2020] by leveraging FaaS to make a cost-efficient execution and placement of AI applications. 

This research project aims: 
1) to benchmark and evaluate the performance of AI applications running in FaaS computing continuum environments, and 
2) to evaluate the effectiveness of component placement algorithms developed in previous research.
